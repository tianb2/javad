_link in a response is part of a hypermedia-driven api idea from REST HATEOAS

it's a convention for including machine-readable hyperlinks in the data so the
client knows what URLs to call next, without hardcoding them

it's like HTML links for programs - guiding navigation between API resources

_links sections is a convention to store those hyperlinks in JSON (HAL format)


Hypermedia

Media = content like JSON, HTML, XML
Hyper = contains links to other resources

html pages have <a /> links that's hypermedia for humans

in APIs, JSON or XML can also contain links but for machines to follow

HATEOAS - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/users/1" },
    "orders": { "href": "/users/1/orders" }
  }
}

{
  "content": "hello me",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=me"
    }
